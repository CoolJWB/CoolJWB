Let me introduce myself, I'm William.

- [Python Calculator](https://github.com/CoolJWB/Python-Calculator) : A calculator that can take a text input and calculate the result from it.
- [TeardownPerformanceMod](https://github.com/CoolJWB/TeardownPerformanceMod) : A Teardown mod that reduces physics calculations by removing small voxels.
- [Minecraft Terrain Generation](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-to-create-a-custom-world-generator.545616/#post-4359392) : A resource for world generation in Minecraft plugins.
- [Minecraft NPCs](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-to-create-and-modify-npcs.400753/) : A resource for creation and management of NPCs in Minecraft plugins.

I have interest in most areas of coding but I plan to stick around game development for a while.
I as of now work part-time at [Teardown](https://teardowngame.com/) with Quality Assurance (QA) but also write [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoolJWB/myworkshopfiles/) for it on my spare time.
