I'm William, a passionate C/C++ programmer from northern Sweden. I am studying for a Bachelor's course in Computer Game Programming at Luleå University of Technology. Self-taught skills and formal education characterize my entire path as a programmer.

Ich bin fluent in Swedish and English, with a basic understanding of German. As someone who lives where the winters are cold and summers hot, I often find the snowy season superior.

My core interests lie in the realm of code optimization. In a world where people overlook efficiency frequently, utilizing the hardware's whole potential is critical. I am driven by the challenge of refining algorithms and writing code to enhance game and application performance.
